# Classifier Agent Prompt

TODO: This prompt will be used when we integrate Neuron with an LLM to replace the current stub.

The prompt should generate a JSON with:
- type: incident type (bug, question, feature, other)
- area: affected area (pos, kds, backoffice, loyalty, infra, other)
- devRelated: boolean indicating if it requires developer intervention
